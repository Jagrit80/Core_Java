Overview
This repository is a personal collection of Java code examples, each demonstrating different core concepts of the language. The repository is organized by topics such as operators, data types, loops, and arrays, with each program providing clear and concise examples. This repository is intended for personal use as a reference and to showcase my Java programming skills.

**Topics Covered**
1. Operators
Arithmetic operators (e.g., +, -, *, /, %)
Relational operators (e.g., ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
Logical operators (e.g., &&, ||, !)
Unary operators (e.g., ++, --)
Assignment operators (e.g., =, +=, -=)
2. Data Types and Variables
Primitive data types (int, double, boolean, char, etc.)
Declaring and initializing variables
3. Control Structures
Conditional statements (if-else, switch)
Loops (for, while, do-while)
4. Arrays
One-dimensional arrays
Multi-dimensional arrays
5. Methods and Functions
Method creation and invocation
Method overloading
6. Input/Output
Using Scanner for user input
Output with System.out.println
